# Asteroids!

## An Interactive Frontend Project by Michael McCann

For my second milestone project, I have deciced to put my JavaScript knowledge to the test and create my version of the classic 1979 classic Atari game, Asteroids. Built using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. I aim to make the user experience more enjoyable for the gamer than its Daddy by giving the game an overhaul on the design.

For ages 6+

# A Bit Of Info On The Game 

[^ Back To Contents ^](#contents)

Asteroids is a space-themed multidirectional shooter arcade game designed by Lyle Rains, Ed Logg, and Dominic Walsh and released in November 1979 by Atari, Inc. The player controls a single spaceship in an asteroid field which is periodically traversed by flying saucers. The object of the game is to shoot and destroy the asteroids and saucers, while not colliding with either, or being hit by the saucers' counter-fire. The game becomes harder as the number of asteroids increases.

Asteroids was one of the first major hits of the golden age of arcade games; the game sold over 70,000 arcade cabinets and proved both popular with players and influential with developers. In the 1980s it was ported to Atari's home systems, and the Atari VCS version sold over three million copies. The game was widely imitated, and it directly influenced Defender, Gravitar, and many other video games.

Asteroids was conceived during a meeting between Logg and Rains, who decided to use hardware developed by Howard Delman previously used for Lunar Lander. Asteroids was based on an unfinished game titled Cosmos; its physics model, control scheme, and gameplay elements were derived from Spacewar!, Computer Space, and Space Invaders and refined through trial and error. The game is rendered on a vector display in a two-dimensional view that wraps around both screen axes.

# The Strategy Plane

[^ Back To Contents ^](#contents)

What I'm aiming to achieve by building a game (my first!) is that it will give me a better insight into my currant knowledge of JavaScript. And what better way than to dive straight in and tackle this classic game, Asteroids!

The use of the arrow keys to move and spacebar to fire will mean that it'll make the game a "pick-up and play" type of game, which makes it suitale for ages 6 and up. So it is ideally for anyone who has an interest in gaming with this game primarily focusing on the retro-gamer who would be very familiar siting in front of a TV (that weighed as much as a washing machine) playing it on their old Atari. Hopefully it will make people feel nostalgic about the hours they played and maybe the fights they had with their siblings over it too! The game will be playable by one person. 

The game is for: 

* Me, the developer to expand my knowledge of JavaScript.
* The retro gamer, to rekindle their love of Asteroids.

# The Scope Plane

[^ Back To Contents ^](#contents)

The features I plan to include in my design are:

* A spaceship

* Asteroids
* Pressing the spacebar to shoot
* Arrow keys to maneuver, up arrow to thrust
* When asteroids are shot, they'll break apart into smaller asteroids
* Scoring system
* High score is saved
* Sound FX and music
* Levels
* Lives 

# The Structure Plane

[^ Back To Contents ^](#contents)

The information or in this case the game will be structured with an ease-of-use interface with all menu items easily accessible for the user. The game will be presented around a fun and enjoyable gameplay with the user wanting to come back for more with the aim of beating their previous high score.

# The Skeleton Plane

## Gameplay

The main objective of Asteroids is to blast the oncoming asteroids and flying saucers that will occassionally appear. The player controls a triangular ship that can rotate left and right, fire shots straight forward, and thrust forward. Once the ship begins moving in a direction, it will continue in that direction for a time without player intervention unless the player applies thrust in a different direction. The ship eventually comes to a stop when not thrusting. The player can also send the ship into hyperspace, causing it to disappear and reappear in a random location on the screen, at the risk of self-destructing or appearing on top of an asteroid.

Each level starts with a few large asteroids drifting in various directions on the screen. Objects wrap around screen edges â€“ for instance, an asteroid that drifts off the top edge of the screen reappears at the bottom and continues moving in the same direction. As the player shoots asteroids, they break into smaller asteroids that move faster and are more difficult to hit. Smaller asteroids are also worth more points. Two flying saucers appear periodically on the screen; the "big saucer" shoots randomly and poorly, while the "small saucer" fires frequently at the ship. After reaching a score of 40,000, only the small saucer appears. As the player's score increases, the angle range of the shots from the small saucer diminishes until the saucer fires extremely accurately. Once the screen has been cleared of all asteroids and flying saucers, a new set of large asteroids appears, thus starting the next level. The player starts with 3 lives when the player loses all their lives, the game ends.

# User Experience

- With a "friction control" of sorts on the spaceship, this brings the ship to a gradual stop, without it, the ship just kept on moving and the gameplay would have been a far more hectic experience.

- With a feature that handles the edge of screen enables the ship to reappear if it flies off the screen. This makes for a much more enjoyable experience for the gamer rather than being frustrated trying to find their spaceship everytime it disappears off screen.

- Added in a graphical element to the thruster, which gives the user visual feedback that something happened when they hold down the UP arrow. This with the increase in the ship's speed provides an all-round good user experience for the potential gamer.

# Design

[^ Back To Contents ^](#contents)

As you can see from this orginal Asteroids in-game design, the developers at the time would have been limited to making the overall look of the game look good as the game is just white vector drawings on a black background. Where I feel the game achieved its success was in the adective gameplay, the need to be the best and to beat your own highscore was what made it a success.

![Orginal Asteroids in-game design](wireframes/og_asteroids.jpeg)

With my version of Asteroids, the gameplay will largely be the same but with the advances in web technologies such as JavaScript, I aim to add more artistic flare to the game design and features. 

Fonts will be in keeping with the style of the retro game so while it's not yet deciced, they'll be in line of [JetBrains Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/JetBrains+Mono).

I aim to have an image of some far-away galaxy as the background image. Such as this: ![Galaxy background](wireframes/galaxy_bg.jpeg)

Asteroids will be floating around the screen in different colours

The spaceship, I'm aiming to build something a bit better than the plain triangular spaceship version of the orginal game. I'll achieve my spaceship by using the Canvas feature of JavaScript.

### Spaceship Colour
- Magenta 

### Thruster Colours:
- #15F00A - Neon green
- Cyan

# Bugs

## Date: Thursday, 17th December, 2020

- With the CANVAS background image, it is not displaying its intended resoultion.
    - Fixed this issue by setting the background image as inline style.

- Stroke line not appearing on the CANVAS. It appears very briefly when I refresh.
    - Fixed this issue by using function init() and window.requestAnimationFrame(draw).

## Date: Friday, 18th December, 2020

- Stroke line appearing pixelated.

    - Fixed this issue by setting the CANVAS width and height as inline style.

## Date: Saturday, 19th December, 2020

- When I use the arrow keys to rotate the ship, the ship duplicates. See attached image [rotation glitch](wireframes/rotate_glitch.png). Works as intended without the galaxy background image. Will continue with development and will try to find a fix later on.

    - Yet to be resolved.
