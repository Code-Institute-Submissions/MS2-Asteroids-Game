# Asteroids!

## An Interactive Frontend Project by Michael McCann

For my second milestone project, I have deciced to put my JavaScript knowledge to the test and create my version of the classic 1979 classic Atari game, Asteroids. Built using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. I aim to make the user experience more enjoyable for the gamer than its Daddy by giving the game an overhaul on the design.

For ages 6+

# A Bit Of Info On The Game 

[^ Back To Contents ^](#contents)

Asteroids is a space-themed multidirectional shooter arcade game designed by Lyle Rains, Ed Logg, and Dominic Walsh and released in November 1979 by Atari, Inc. The player controls a single spaceship in an asteroid field which is periodically traversed by flying saucers. The object of the game is to shoot and destroy the asteroids and saucers, while not colliding with either, or being hit by the saucers' counter-fire. The game becomes harder as the number of asteroids increases.

Asteroids was one of the first major hits of the golden age of arcade games; the game sold over 70,000 arcade cabinets and proved both popular with players and influential with developers. In the 1980s it was ported to Atari's home systems, and the Atari VCS version sold over three million copies. The game was widely imitated, and it directly influenced Defender, Gravitar, and many other video games.

Asteroids was conceived during a meeting between Logg and Rains, who decided to use hardware developed by Howard Delman previously used for Lunar Lander. Asteroids was based on an unfinished game titled Cosmos; its physics model, control scheme, and gameplay elements were derived from Spacewar!, Computer Space, and Space Invaders and refined through trial and error. The game is rendered on a vector display in a two-dimensional view that wraps around both screen axes.

The above text is taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)).

# The Strategy Plane

What I'm aiming to achieve by building a game (my first!) is that it will give me a better insight into my currant knowledge of JavaScript. And what better way than to dive straight in and tackle this classic game, Asteroids!

The use of the arrow keys to move and spacebar to fire will mean that it'll make the game a "pick-up and play" type of game, which makes it suitale for ages 6 and up. So it is ideally for anyone who has an interest in gaming with this game primarily focusing on the retro-gamer who would be very familiar siting in front of a TV (that weighed as much as a washing machine) playing it on their old Atari. Hopefully it will make people feel nostalgic about the hours they played and maybe the fights they had with their siblings over it too! The game will be playable by one person. 

The game is for: 

* Me, the developer to expand my knowledge of JavaScript.
* The retro gamer, to rekindle their love of Asteroids.

# The Scope Plane

The features I plan to include in my design are:

* A spaceship

* Asteroids
* Pressing the spacebar to shoot
* Arrow keys to maneuver, up arrow to thrust
* When asteroids are shot, they'll break apart into smaller asteroids
* Scoring system
* High score is saved
* Sound FX and music
* Levels
* Lives

# The Structure Plane

[^ Back To Contents ^](#contents)

The information or in this case the game will be structured with an ease-of-use interface with all menu items easily accessible for the user. The game will be presented around a fun and enjoyable gameplay with the user wanting to come back for more with the aim of beating their previous high score.

# The Skeleton Plane

## Gameplay

The main objective of Asteroids is to blast the oncoming asteroids and flying saucers that will occassionally appear. The player controls a triangular ship that can rotate left and right, fire shots straight forward, and thrust forward. Once the ship begins moving in a direction, it will continue in that direction for a time without player intervention unless the player applies thrust in a different direction. The ship eventually comes to a stop when not thrusting. The player can also send the ship into hyperspace, causing it to disappear and reappear in a random location on the screen, at the risk of self-destructing or appearing on top of an asteroid.

Each level starts with a few large asteroids drifting in various directions on the screen. Objects wrap around screen edges â€“ for instance, an asteroid that drifts off the top edge of the screen reappears at the bottom and continues moving in the same direction. As the player shoots asteroids, they break into smaller asteroids that move faster and are more difficult to hit. Smaller asteroids are also worth more points. Two flying saucers appear periodically on the screen; the "big saucer" shoots randomly and poorly, while the "small saucer" fires frequently at the ship. After reaching a score of 40,000, only the small saucer appears. As the player's score increases, the angle range of the shots from the small saucer diminishes until the saucer fires extremely accurately. Once the screen has been cleared of all asteroids and flying saucers, a new set of large asteroids appears, thus starting the next level. The player starts with 3 lives when the player loses all their lives, the game ends.

# User Experience

- With a "friction control" of sorts on the spaceship, this brings the ship to a gradual stop, without it, the ship just kept on moving and the gameplay would have been a far more hectic experience.

- With a feature that handles the edge of screen enables the ship to reappear if it flies off the screen. This makes for a much more enjoyable experience for the gamer rather than being frustrated trying to find their spaceship everytime it disappears off screen.

    - The above feature has also been added to the asteroids.

- Added in a graphical element to the thruster, which gives the user visual feedback that something happened when they hold down the UP arrow. This with the increase in the ship's speed provides an all-round good user experience for the potential gamer.

- When the last asteroid is destroyed, game continues with an extra asteroid and increased speed in game. The gradual increased difficulty in the game will get the user excited. A visual reputation of the level they are on will give them bragging rights amoungst their friends!

- As part of the UX, when the player loses a life, the life flashes a different colour (Cyan) and then disappears.

# Design

[^ Back To Contents ^](#contents)

As you can see from this orginal Asteroids in-game design, the developers at the time would have been limited to making the overall look of the game look good as the game is just white vector drawings on a black background. Where I feel the game achieved its success was in the adective gameplay, the need to be the best and to beat your own highscore was what made it a success.

![Orginal Asteroids in-game design](wireframes/og_asteroids.jpeg)

With my version of Asteroids, the gameplay will largely be the same but with the advances in web technologies such as JavaScript, I aim to add more artistic flare to the game design and features. Also, it will be fully responsive and will be playable on mobile devices.

Fonts will be in keeping with the style of the retro game so while it's not yet deciced, they'll be in line of [JetBrains Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/JetBrains+Mono). I deciced to go against applying a retro type of font as it didn't look as well as I hoped. Helvetica works much better than I thought so I stayed away from adding in any unnecessary fonts and just kept that part simple.

I aim to have an image of some far-away galaxy as the background image. Such as this: 

![Galaxy background](wireframes/galaxy_bg.jpeg)

Asteroids will be floating around the screen in different colours

The colour palette I chose were to represent a futuristic sci-fi world. The bright neon colours against the black background of the nav bar and against the galaxy setting makes these colours standout and achieve their desired effect.

### Fonts
- Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif: Used for Menu

- Impact: Used for in-game text (Note: This appears as a plain serif on mobile devices)

### Nav and Menu Buttons:
- Text colour: White

- Background colour: #1f1f1f - Charcoal colour
- Active state: 6px, solid, magenta
- Hover state: 6px, solid, yellow
- Visited state: 6px, solid, cyan

### Spaceship Colour:
- Magenta 

### Asteroid Colour:
- #15aF00A - Neon green

### Thruster Colours:
- #15F00A - Neon green
- Cyan

### Explosion Ship Colours:
- #F61638 - Red colour
- #F68738 - Orange colour
- #F6D438 - Yellow colour
- White

### Explosion Asteroid Colours:
- #F70A49 - Red colour
- #F77349 - Orange colour
- #F7CA49 - Yellow colour

### Laser Colour:
- #F6FF38 - Yellow colour

### In-Game Text:
- Font - Impact
- Font size - 90px
- Font colour - 247, 243, 15 - Yellow colour

### In-Game Lives Colours:
- Magenta 
- Flashes Cyan when player loses a life

The only deviation from my wireframes is I deciced to drop the Bootstrap menu and went for a more simplistic approach, as I felt that having a collapasable menu along with the added styles of a Bootstrap navvbar would only get in the way just for a couple of menu items.

- Used Google to get RGB values.
- Used Preview on Mac to resize and crop images.
- Used [nekoCalc](https://nekocalc.com/px-to-em-converter) to convert pixels to ems.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) was used to assist with the responsiveness (i.e. On mobile devices menu collapses down to a square button) and styling of the website. (Bootstrap was used during the early design phase but it was later dropped.)
- [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/workspaces). Development environment used to build the project.
    - Git was used for version control.
- [GitHub](https://github.com) is used to store the projects code after being saved from GitPod and then Pushed from the terminal using Git commands.

# Bugs

## Date: Thursday, 17th December, 2020

- With the CANVAS background image, it is not displaying its intended resoultion.
    - Fixed this issue by setting the background image as inline style.

- Stroke line not appearing on the CANVAS. It appears very briefly when I refresh.
    - Fixed this issue by using function init() and window.requestAnimationFrame(draw).
        - Code is working as intended without using the above code.

## Date: Friday, 18th December, 2020

- Stroke line appearing pixelated.

    - Fixed this issue by setting the CANVAS width and height as inline style.

## Date: Saturday, 19th December, 2020

- When I use the arrow keys to rotate the ship, the ship duplicates. See attached image [rotation glitch](wireframes/rotate_glitch.png). Works as intended without the galaxy background image. Will continue with development and will try to find a fix later on.

    - Fix this issue by using: ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canv.width, canv.height);.

## Date: Thursday, 31st December, 2020

- When I use the arrow keys to rotate the ship, the lives in the top corner are also rotating.

    - Fixed this issue by revising my code. Forgot to remove ship.a from function drawShip.

## Date: Monday, 4th January, 2021

- The scrollbar was interferring with the gameplay, especially when the spacebar was pressed to shoot. There was a bit of horizontal scroll which was making the page jump when playing. 

    - Fixed this simply by removing the footer in index.html and removed width 100vh and changed it to % in #game-container.

## Date: Wednesday, 6th January, 2021

- When I remove the inline style for the CANVAS element size to make the CANVAS responsive, the game disappears completely.

    - Fixed this issue by stripping the code right back and basically rebuilt the index page, assigned styles to the CANVAS element and also through JavaScript.

- In-game text is different on mobile devices, should be Impact, but on iPhone and iPad it's a plain serif font.

    - Yet to be resolved.

- No sound on mobile devices.

    - Yet to be resolved.

## Date: Wednesday, 13th  January, 2021

- Through game testing, it was pointed out to me that the ship got lost if went off the side of the screen.

    - This was quickly amended by adding code to the JavaScript file that handles the edge of the screen.

# Learning Resources

Pretty much got all of problem solving done with [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/).

In order to figure out how to make the CANVAS fully responsive, I found this video to be quite useful. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm7py_lZkL8&t=98s

Another great video I watched for debugging, which was recommended by CI's tutoring team, Tim Nelson was this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AX7uybwukkk

Used [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) to figure out how to place a background image into a canvas element.

Watched [Derek Banas's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWuU5ly0taA&t=529s) Asteroid tutorial video on YouTube.

Also watched [The Coding Train's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hacZU523FyM&t=32s) Asteroid tutorial video on YouTube.

Read this tutorial to learn how to pause the game. https://atomicrobotdesign.com/blog/web-development/pause-your-html5-canvas-game/

Thanks to my mentor, Brian Macharia for his guidence and valuable feedback.
To fellow Code Institute student, Kristian Andersen for all of his assistance, really appreciated, Kristian! To the guys on Slack, Ed B and the excellent support given to me by the tutoring team as this was a quite difficult project for me to undertake. Perhaps building a game wasn't my brightest idea!
